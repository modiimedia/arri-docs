title: Type Schemas
description: ''
---

Arri Type Definitions (ATD) are a superset of [JSON Type Definitions (AKA RFC 8927)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8927.html). Currently the only changes to the specification are the addition of `int64` and `uint64` types. Everything acts the same as a normal JTD.

The following examples are taken from the JTD [website](https://jsontypedef.com/), which is no longer online.

## "Empty" schema

Example:

```json
{}
```

Empty schemas accept any JSON value.

## "Type" schema

A type schema can be used to specify a primitive JSON value. For example,

```json
{ "type": "string" }
```

will accept any JSON string, while

```json
{ "type": "boolean" }
```

will only accept `true` or `false`

Below are all of the accepted types

| type      | What it accepts                                                                                                                | Example                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| boolean   | **true** or **false**                                                                                                          | true                      |
| string    | JSON strings                                                                                                                   | "hello"                   |

## "Enum" schema

An enum schema can be used to say something must be a string in a given list. For example,

```json
{
    "enum": ["FOO", "BAR", "BAZ"]
}
```

Will accept only "FOO", "BAR", and "BAZ". Any other value will be rejected. Enum values must be strings they cannot be numbers.

## "Elements" schema

The elements schema is used to describe an array. The value of the `elements` property is another Arri Schema. For example,

```json
{ "elements": { "type": "string" } }
```

Accepts arrays where every element is a string. So `["foo", "bar"]` and `[]` will be accepted, but `"foo"` and `[1, 2, 3]` will be rejected.

## "Properties" schema

The "properties" schema is used to describe JSON objects. For example,

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "isAdmin": { "type": "boolean" }
    }
}
```

Accepts objects that have a `name` property (which must be a string) and a `isAdmin` property (which must be a boolean). So this is OK:

```json
{ "name": "John Doe", "isAdmin": true }
```

But this isn't

```json
{ "name": "John Doe", "isAdmin": 1 }
```

### Optional Properties

To specify if it's OK for a property to be missing you can use the `optionalProperties` field:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "isAdmin": { "type": "boolean" }
    },
    "optionalProperties": {
        "middleName": { "type": "string" }
    }
}
```

If the object contains a `middleName` property it must be a string. However if there isn't a `middleName` property it will still be accepted. So both of these examples are valid:

```json
{ "name": "John Doe", "isAdmin": true }
```

```json
{ "name": "John Doe", "isAdmin": false, "middleName": "Joseph" }
```

### Additional Properties

By default, `properties / optionalProperties` will not allow properties that are not explicitly specified in the schema. To allow extra properties when parsing and validating set `additionalProperties` to `true`. For example:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "isAdmin": { "type": "boolean" }
    },
    "additionalProperties": true
}
```

Would accept:

```json
{ "name": "John Doe", "isAdmin": true, "extra": "stuff" }
```

::card
It is **highly recommended** that Arri server or client implementation set this option to `true` by default. This will prevent errors when adding additional fields to a schema when services have already been pushed to production. The reason why this default isn't baked into the Arri Schemas is in order to conform to the JTD specification.

## "Values" schema

To describe a JSON object that’s like a “dictionary” or "record", where you don’t know the keys but you do know what type the values should have, use a “values” schema. The value of the values keyword is another JTD schema. For example,

```json
{ "values": { "types": "boolean" } }
```

Accepts JSON objects where all of the values are booleans. So it would accept `{}` or `{"a": true, "b": false}`, but not `{"a": 1}`

## "Discriminator" schemas

To describe a JSON object that works like a [tagged union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) (aka: “discriminated union”, “sum type”), use a “discriminator” schema.

A “discriminator” schema has two keywords: discriminator tells you what property is the “tag” property, and mapping tells you what schema to use, based on the value of the “tag” property.

For example, let’s say you have messages that look like this:

```json
{ "eventType": "USER_CREATED", "id": "users/123" }
{ "eventType": "USER_CREATED", "id": "users/456" }

{ "eventType": "USER_PAYMENT_PLAN_CHANGED", "id": "users/789", "plan": "PAID" }
{ "eventType": "USER_PAYMENT_PLAN_CHANGED", "id": "users/123", "plan": "FREE" }

{ "eventType": "USER_DELETED", "id": "users/456", "softDelete": false }
```

Basically, there are three kinds of messages: USER_CREATED messages look like this:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" }
    }
}
```

USER_PAYMENT_PLAN_CHANGED messages look like this:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "plan": { "enum": ["FREE", "PAID"] }
    }
}
```

And USER_DELETED messages look like this:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "softDelete": { "type": "boolean" }
    }
}
```

With a “discriminator” schema, you can tie all three of those schemas together, and tell JTD that you decide which one is relevant based on the value of eventType. So here’s the schema for our messages:

```json
{
    "discriminator": "eventType",
    "mapping": {
        "USER_CREATED": {
            "properties": {
                "id": { "type": "string" }
            }
        },
        "USER_PAYMENT_PLAN_CHANGED": {
            "properties": {
                "id": { "type": "string" },
                "plan": { "enum": ["FREE", "PAID"] }
            }
        },
        "USER_DELETED": {
            "properties": {
                "id": { "type": "string" },
                "softDelete": { "type": "boolean" }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That schema would accept all of the messages in our example above. If the input doesn’t have a eventType property, or if the eventType property isn’t one of the three values mentioned in the mapping, then the input is rejected.

You can only use properties / optionalProperties / additionalProperties in the schemas you put directly in mapping. You can’t use any other kind of schema, otherwise things would become ambiguous.

## Global Options

### The nullable keyword

You can put nullable on any schema (regardless of which “form” it takes), and that will make null be an acceptable value for the schema.

For example,

{ "type": "string" }
Will accept "foo" and reject null. But if you add "nullable": true,

{ "type": "string", "nullable": true }
That schema will accept both "foo" and null.

Note: you can’t put nullable on a schema in a discriminator mapping. If you want a discriminator to be nullable, you have to put it at the same level as the discriminator and mapping keywords.

### The metadata keyword

The metadata keyword is legal on any schema, and if it’s present it has to be a JSON object. There are no constraints on what you can put in metadata beyond that, and metadata has no effect on validation.

#### Affects on code-generation

During code-generation Arri will look for the following properties

-   `metadata.id`
-   `metadata.description`

`id` is used to explicitly specify what the generated type name should be. For example:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "email": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "metadata": {
        "id": "User"
    }
}
```

Will always generate types named `User` no matter how nested they are within other schemas. Additionally, if an id has already been generated Arri will skip to the next schema to prevent from duplicating types.

::card
It's recommended that any Arri server implementation should add `metadata.id` to any auto-generated schemas based on the type name specified in the source code. So for example if you have a rust proc-macro that converts structs to ATD's, the name of the struct should be added to `metadata.id`.
::

#### Description

Any schema with `metadata.description` will have code comments added to the generated type containing that description. This is useful as you can add documentation to the users of the generated clients. For example when processing the following schema,

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "email": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "metadata": {
        "id": "User",
        "description": "This is an Arri user"
    }
}
```

Arri will generate a TS type that looks like this

```ts
// This is an Arri user
interface User {
    name: string;
    email: string;
}
```

and a Dart class that looks like this

```dart
/// This is an Arri user
class User {
    final String name;
    final String email;
    const User({required this.name, required this.email,});
    // rest of class
}
```
