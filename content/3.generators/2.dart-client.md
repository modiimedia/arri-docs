## Add the dart client generator to your Arri config

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'arri';
import { dartClientGenerator } from 'arri/dist/codegen';

export default defineConfig({
    clientGenerators: [
        dartClientGenerator({
            clientName: 'MyClient',
            outputFile: '<path-to-desired-file-location>.dart',
        }),
    ],
});
```

## Install the `arri_client` library

The generated code relies on [arri_client](https://pub.dev/packages/arri_client). So you will need to install it in whatever project utilizes the generated code. Also bear in mind that the version should match your arri cli version.

```bash
dart pub add arri_client
```
